<p>Given the prevalence of Twitter as a platform for expressing political sentiment and the increasing use of Twitter by politicians as a means to engage with their electorate, I wanted to explore the utility of Twitter as an indicator of political sentiment. In general, the objective of this project is to attempt to see what the general Twitter user base thinks of the United States 2016 Presidential Election and how candidates themselves portray themselves on the platform. In order to simplify the scope of analysis and to mediate with the nature of twitter data in general, I limited the scope of tweets to those that are explicitly found on candidate profiles. I further simplified general user tweets to those that explicitly mention candidates in their tweets via hashtags. Lastly, in order to further simplify the analysis, I steered away from attempting to analysis user sentiment towards candidates and instead focused on the sentiment of candidates themselves. 

	As an additional layer of analysis that adds  dimensionality to candidate sentiment is to visualize the terms more commonly associated with each candidate. Though distinct from the initial sentiment analysis foundation, this additional layer of analysis helps shape and also complicate the manner in which candidates portray themselves and how they are perceived.</p>
