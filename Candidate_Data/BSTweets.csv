"Under Gov. Walker, we are seeing massive efforts to make it harder for people to vote in Wisconsin. Absolutely wrong and unacceptable."
"In 1980, Congress required credit unions to cap interest rates at 15 percent. It's time to extend this cap to every lender in America."

Families are struggling to put bread on the table and take care of their basic needs. America needs a political revolution.
