"As Secretary, Hillary implemented reforms to protect diplomats and help prevent future attacks. #BenghaziCommittee
"
"To truly honor those lost at Benghazi, we need to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the brave Americans who do their work."
America must do all we can to protect our personnel doing the important work of representing our interests and values around the world.
The work of Chris Stevens and his colleagues represented the best of this approach to foreign policy.
"America must pursue a smart brand of leadership that integrates and balances the tools of diplomacy, development, and defense."
"We cannot return to the go-it-alone foreign policy of the past, where military-based solutions are pursued as a first option."
American diplomats cannot conduct their work from bunkers. Advancing US interests often means going to unstable regions.
Hillary is testifying before  to defend the vision of US diplomacy that Ambassador Stevens gave his life carrying out.
America must continue to lead in a dangerous world. To do otherwise would mean drawing the wrong lesson from the Benghazi tragedy.
A lesson from Benghazi: Congress needs to do its part to ensure that our diplomats in dangerous parts of the world are as safe as possible.
"We need leadership that puts national security ahead of politics and ideology. #BenghaziCommittee

"""We need leadership at home to match our leadership abroad. Leadership that puts national security ahead of politics and ideology."" Hillary"
"""Efforts to establish a modern joint training center are being held up by Congress. The men and women who serve our country deserve better."""
"""There is more to do, and no administration can do it alone. Congress has to be our partner as it has been after previous tragedies."""
"""I pledged  one [of the Accountability Review Board's recommendations] would be on the way to implementation. And they were."""
"""We have a responsibility to provide diplomats with the resources &amp; support they need to do their jobs as safely &amp; effectively as possible."""
